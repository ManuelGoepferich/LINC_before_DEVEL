Description: This package enables the annotation of ncRNAs based on expression datasets. The underlying principle is called 'guilty by association' meaning a non-coding RNA is assumed to the have the a similar biological function as the group of its associated (co-expressed) protein-coding genes. In the first step a correlation matrix is computed storing the correlation of coding and non-coding genes. Secondly, query genes and their associated genes with high correlations can be extracted. The third step calls a gene ontology to retrieve the biological function of associated genes.
